* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
* Hypertext means "text with links in it". Any time you click on a word or link that brings you to a new webpage, you've clicked on hypertext.
* A markup language is a programming language that is used to make text do more than just sit on a page. It can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, and much more.
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it's the thing that makes webpages look pretty. You can think of it like skin and makeup that covers HTML pages.
* Double-click on the file called 'index.html' in the 'Lesson_1' folder. This is an html file and we'll be adding to it over the course of this lesson.
* The file looks empty but actually it's not - you just can't see the things that are in there right now. Let's open it...
* On your desktop, navigate to the 'BracketsPortable' folder and open the 'BracketsPortable.exe' file. 
* Brackets is an HTML editor and we'll be using it to modify the web page.
* In Brackets, go to the 'File' menu and click on 'Open Folder'
* Navigate to the GWN Fex2016Projects folder on your desktop and select the Lesson 1 folder to open.
