/*
	This intro lesson will teach you how to use radar and gun of your robot.
	In the Robocode game, angles increase in a clockwise direction starting from "North". 
	This means the top wall is at 0 degrees, the right wall is at 90 degrees, and the left wall is at 270 degrees. 
	Take a look at 'RobocodeAngles.jpg' in the 'Lesson_2' folder for an overview of the angles. 

	Pre-flight Instructions:
	1. Follow the numbered instructions in order. E.g. #1 -- Move the radar in a 360 degree circle around your robot -> would be the first thing you do
   	2. In Java, lines must end with a semi-colon. Don't forget to add one at the end of each line.
   	3. In Java, functions are case-sensitive, make sure you are typing a function name exactly as it looks in the reference comment.
   	4. After finishing every comment, save the program (Ctrl+S), and then compile it (Ctrl+B).
   	5. You can add your robot to the battlefield after every save to see what you've just changed.

   	Testing your robot on the battlefield:
    1. If you don't have the Robocode program already open, double-click the 'robocode.bat' file in the Robocode folder
    2. Click the 'Battle' menu, then select New
    3. Under the 'Packages' column, select 'gwntutorial'. You should now see the list of GWN robots in the 'Robots' column on the right.
    4. Pick the robot you're working on from the left (e.g. ScanTutorial) and press 'Add' button.
    5. Pick another robot you want to battle against. (e.g. sample.Crazy) and press 'Add' button.
    6. Press the 'Start Battle' button.
    
    Additional reference information and documentation is available in the 'javadoc' folder under 'Robocode'

// This lesson will teach you how to use the radar to scan the battlefield. The scanner is the fastest moving part of your robot, so it's important to learn how to use it well.
// Your robot has a few senses: sense of touch, sense of sight, meta senses
// Sense of touch: Your robot knows when it's hit a wall, been hit by a bullet, or if it hit another robot
// Meta senses: Your robot knows when it's died, or when another robot has died. It also knows if a bullet hits a wall or another bullet.
