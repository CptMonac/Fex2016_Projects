  Pre-Flight Instructions
  1. On the left, you should see two folders - 'assets', and 'libraries'. 
     Don't see them?
      * Click on the gear icon on the top right. 
      * Scroll to the 'Show sidebar' option, then click 'On'. 
  
  2. Follow the comments with numbers in order and delete the comments once you are finished with them.

  3. Any functions you need will be called out in a 'reference' comment. Some of these reference comments
     will also include examples to show you how to use the function.
