<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This tells your browser that this document is an html document -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- This tells your browser which language the page will use. Yes, this can be Yoruba, Igbo or Hausa for example -->
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- Ignore this for now, but this section is used if you wanted to use a different alphabet, like Arabic characters for example -->
    
    <!-- #1: Enter the name of your company in-between the 'title' tag below. 
        
        Reference: The 'title' tag tells your browser the title of your page. It shows up as the text inside a browser tab.
            E.g. <title> Awesome company </title> -> this sets the title of your page as Awesome company
    -->
    <title>Hooli </title>   
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css"> <!-- This tells your browser how to style and decorate your html page -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This is where everything you see on a web page goes -->
    
    <!-- #2: Create a header with your company name in the web page.
        
        Reference: The <h1> tag allows you to create a header for text on a page. You can also create headers of smaller sizes using <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> or <h6> tags
            E.g. <h1>My company header </h1> -> This creates a header with the text 'My company header'
    -->
    <h1>Hooli</h1>
      
    <!-- #3: Let's add a picture to your web page. Add the 'companypic.jpg' picture located in the assets folder to the webpage.
        
        Reference: The <img> tag allows you to add images to your web page. 
                   You specify which image to add using an attribute called "src".
                   The <img> tag is not like the other tags you've seen so far. It does not require a closing tag.
            E.g. <img src="assets/danity.jpg"> -> will add an image called 'danity.jpg' from the assets folder
    -->
    <img src="assets/companypic.jpg" width="800px">
      
    <!-- #4: The image seems a little big. Let's make it smaller.
             Modify the image above to have a width of 800 pixels
        
        Reference: The 'width' attribute for the <img> tag allows you to control the display width for an image.
            E.g. <img src="assets/danity.jpg" width="200px"> -> will set the width to the 'danity.jpg' image to 200 pixels.
    -->
      
    <!-- #5.1: Let's center-align the site so everything is not hugging the left edge.
               Double click on the 'style.css' file under the assets folder on the left.
               We will edit the styles of the text we already have on the page.
    -->
      
    <!-- #6: Let's add more information about your company to the website.
             Add information about what your company does and sells to the site

        Reference: The <p> tag creates a paragraph where you can put text on a website.
            E.g. <p>My company creates awesome diagrams and presentation materials for company board meetings.</p> 
            This example creates a paragraph with the text above.
    -->
      <p>Hooli's goal is to make the world a better place. Our company builds awesome stuff for some awesome people. We create board room chairs, meetings, motivational posters and the like.We're more than the chat, mail, search and phone that's crowned Hooli as the most respected brand in the world. We're bigger than our unrivaled Hooli cloud computing services. Our products are more than hardware or software. We are mor than just APIs, NFC, IDEs, SDKs...FYI.

    <!-- #7: Let's add more information about the founders of the company to the website.
             Create another paragraph with a short biography of each of the founders.

    <!-- #8: Let's add links to your social media company pages to the site.
             Add links for Facebook and Twitter to your site.
             
        Reference: The <a> tag is called an anchor tag and allows you to add links to other sites on your websites.
                   You use the "href" attribute of the tag to tell the browser which site you want to link to. Don't forget to add 'http://' in front of the website you want to visit.
            E.g. <a href="http://www.google.com"> Visit our Google </a> -> This creates a link that links to Google.com when you click the text "Visit our Google"
    -->
      <a href="http://www.Facebook.com">Facebook</a>
      <a href="http://www.Twitter.com">Twitter</a>
    
    <!-- #9.1: Let's style those links you created to look more like buttons.
               Double-click on the 'style.css' file under the assets folder on the left.
